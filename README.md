# Typing Speed Test Application

A simple, clean, and interactive web-based typing speed test designed to help users improve their typing accuracy and words per minute (WPM). This project is built using fundamental web technologies: HTML for structure, pure CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality.

* **Performance Metrics:** Displays your Words Per Minute (WPM) and typing accuracy percentage upon test completion.
* **Random Sentences:** Tests your typing skills with a variety of randomly selected text passages.
* **Responsive Layout:** Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.
* **Pure CSS Styling:** All visual styling, including gradients, shadows, and responsive adjustments, is implemented using only native CSS (no frameworks like Tailwind CSS).
